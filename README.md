# CALCULATOR-ASSISTANT
This is a Calculator which can be used to calculate and graph demonstration. Conversions can also be done using this Calculator.

To Access the Calculator Assistant,some things needs to be sorted in your computer for perfect functioning.
As it is a Python Programme,Python should be installed in your computer.Please ensure that the python version is 3.x .

While installing the setup,you have to check whether the path of the python application is setup or not.

Later you have to check whether it has pip package pre-installed in it if your version is not 3.x.

Libraries and Modules to be installed before this are:
1.matplotlib
	To install matplotlib,enter"pip install matplotlib"in command prompt while connected to internet.
2.statistics
	To install statistics,enter"pip install statistics"in command prompt while connected to internet.

If your pip version is not the required version then you have to update it using"pip install--upgrade pip" command in command prompt. 


Now to use the Calculator Assistant,right click on the file and click 'Edit With IDLE' and press F5 or Click RUN Program. 


If you want to change the password of the file,you must have to right click on the file and select "Edit With IDLE" option. 

Then go to the bottom most portion of the file. There you will see a portion as def pswd(): 
	then look forward to the statement starting with if and looks like if p=="********" and then modify the ******** with your desired password within the inverted commas(").

Then go to the topmost region of the file and look for the statement 
			" THE PASSWORD IS :********" and change the ******** to your password set previously for your future help while opening the file in case you forget it.

I wish I am able to solve all the basic problems you would face working with it.
